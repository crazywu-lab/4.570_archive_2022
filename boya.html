              <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
              <p>
                Borges was born in Argentina, while his work includes detailed imagination of places all over the world.
                <br>His writing map is actually the map of his reading history – his fantasy landscape is based on some
                geographic references and some fabrication, which like a random mixture.

              <h2>Project Overview</h2>
              <p>
                This study explores the visualization of geological and fantastic landscapes in fictions by machine
                learning. Can we design a new kind of landscape from the inspiration of text? Can AI go beyond personal
                bias?
              </p>
              <p>
                Both landscape and literature are artificial while arranged by human consciousness, which is influenced
                by personal experience and cultural context. Borges is a writer from Argentina, whose work includes
                detailed imagination of places all over the world based on his worldwide reading history. Therefore,
                fantasy landscape in Borges’ fictions is a mixture of realistic references and fabrication. With the
                machine learning of natural language and pix to pix, AI can grab the geographical elements in the novel
                rapidly and generate a new kind of landscape that goes beyond personal bias. In this way, it is possible
                to explore the new genre and form of landscape and interactive reader’s experiences.

              <p>
                This experiment tests the relationship between fantasy literature created by human and illustration from internet (big data resources) and machine learning. It shows a new possibility of exploring landscape in a more flexible way. However, the manually color-coding is not precise. A better way to generate it should be explored. Also, it is necessary to figure out how to inspire the design of real landscape with these fantastic and geographic illustrations.
